From the second of his birth, to the end of his life, he was the most talented of all on Earth, and too much talent brings out the worst of surrounding people.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Outcast, cold, loner, and more were words that usually were used to describe Rej as a child as jealousy and other negative emotions came easily to people since he almost never had any trouble with anything as Rej learned everything at about 10x the rate of a genius of geniuses.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But because of his isolation, and lack of human interaction, he was helpless in the matter of how actual people thought like. But, Rej was also pure as because of his thirst of knowledge, he knew that people couldn't help with these emotions and decided to become the one that people would admire.\n </p>\n <p>\n  Rej would be the one to help others and bring happiness to others even at his own expense, but he only did these things on a whim as they also brought a smile to his face, so he wasn't a complete saint as he was human and also had his own desires. But he was immortal, and was only mortal to his own intent, so everyone knew the outcome of Rej being depressed and bored with life after a few thousand years of boredom.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But with his own death, and the death of his own mind, a new mind was made with the same soul as the core.Â This new mind also had experienced the experiences of the soul but responded with different wants and needs to those memories and decided to act not as a person to admire, but one did whatever he wanted and would sometimes be called a monster and sometimes called a savior those who were lucky and unlucky. Although, there might be more unlucky as this was a newborn mind who only had a moment of life before experiencing this soul.\n </p>\n <p>\n  ...\n </p>\n <p>\n  ...\n </p>\n <p>\n  If one was to truly do what they wanted, they would be called both the lord and the devil, as their emotions and wants dictated their logic, and those who truly do what they want, have the power to change all at a whims notice. As many people want, Cud will do, the wanting resulting in the doing of controlling time on a whim.\n </p>\n <p>\n  ...\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span style=""color: #ffcc00"">\n   (Although the way I wrote this seems like someone who is actually being serious with their writing of someone who can control everything, it's not, as I'm not going to be serious and just do what I want with this. So if\n   <strong>\n    <em>\n     you\n    </em>\n   </strong>\n   want to run away with this concept, you\n   <em>\n    can\n   </em>\n   , just don't copy and paste...please...)\n  </span>\n </p>\n <p>\n  <span style=""color: #3366ff"">\n   (Also the picture is not owned by me so if you own it and want me to change it, you can tell me)\n  </span>\n </p>\n</div>\n",""

His father left him when he was little and his mother can't be called a mother. His entire life he was mocked by his schoolmates or ignored. No one really liked him.\n </p>\n <p>\n  All this got even worse when the game RoyalRoad came out. He couldn't afford it and so the mockery got worse. Even some teachers mocked him because of it. A democracy where teachers should help their students? What a joke.\n </p>\n <p>\n  But wheels of fate had different objectives.
